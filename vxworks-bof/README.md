# VxWorks BoF

## Description

For those interested in learning more about [ROS2 on VxWorks](https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-ros2-build) project, that provides a build environment to automate building ROS2 with a VxWorks SDK.
VxWorks is a deterministic, priority-based preemptive real-time operating system with low latency and minimal jitter.
We’ll talk about what is VxWorks, VxWorks SDK, and how to use the latest ROS2 humble release on VxWorks.
Please join a Birds of a Feather session at ROSCon 2022 happening on Day 2 during Lunch (1320-1350 JST). We’ll meet at “Humble” which is 1F near the Main Hall, see https://roscon.ros.org/2022/#community for the map and ROSCon2022BOFs schedule.
