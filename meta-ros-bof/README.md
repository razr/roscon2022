# meta-ros

## Description

meta-ros is Yocto Linux based ROS/ROS2 layers that were maintained until mid-2022 by LG (kudos). We want to talk about further steps in supporting meta-ros by the community.

Please join a Birds of a Feather session at ROSCon 2022 happening on Day 1 during Break 2 (1510-1540 JST). We’ll meet at `Humble` which is 1F near the Main Hall, see a https://roscon.ros.org/2022/#community for the map and ROSCon2022BOFs schedule.
